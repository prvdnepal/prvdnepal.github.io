            <p><span style="font-size: 48px;"><strong>Significant benefits to Nepal</strong></span></p>
            <p><br>The benefits to Nepal will be significant.</p>
            <p><br><strong>Dramatic financial savings</strong> &ndash; The costs per kilometer / passenger should be less than the total<br>cost of ownership of a moped. This means that riders will spend less to ride the podway than to<br>ride a moped. Further, riders will not need to buy motorbikes or cars; they will not need to take<br>them for maintenance. This will save a lot of time.</p>
            <p><br><strong>Improved safety</strong> &ndash; Last year we had 247 traffic fatalities in the Kathmandu Valley &ndash; and the<br>number of deaths is increasing. Injuries in traffic accidents are measured in the thousands. The<br>Podway will eliminate nearly all traffic accidents and injuries.</p>
            <p><strong>Rapid transportation</strong> &ndash; Everyone knows that traffic jams in the Kathmandu slow traffic to a<br>crawl. By building grade separation &ndash; providing a separate micro-rail about 8 meters off the<br>ground &ndash; we will speed traffic by stopping only at boarding stations. In fact, if there is no need<br>for a pod to stop at a boarding station, we will speed through the stops. We will never stop at<br>intersections. We expect to see traffic move speeds accelerate from 10 km an hour to about 40<br>km an hour &ndash; including tops at boarding stations.</p>
            <p><br><strong>Eliminate pollution&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; Kathmandu has earned the position of the most polluted city in the world.<br>Much of that pollution is due to motorbikes, cars, trucks, and buses. This is pollution is driving<br>health problems at an unprecedented rate. Our pods will be powered by hydro power. Our pods<br>will have a life span of 25 years or more &ndash; not the 5 years we normally see with cars.</p>
            <p><br><strong>New employment and educational opportunities</strong> &ndash; Many people would like to study at schools<br>or take new jobs in other parts of the city &ndash; but can&rsquo;t because they can&rsquo;t afford the travel costs<br>and time. The podway will offer opportunities that were not available before.</p>
            <p><br><strong>Revolutionary tourism opportunity</strong> &ndash; As we build the podway network across the country, we<br>will attract tourists around the world to visit Nepal and travel on the most modern<br>transportation system available.</p>
