Further, air travel enjoys the lowest number of deaths or injuries per passenger kilometer compared with any other form of transportation. Air travel excels at high speed and extraordinary safety. Air travelers must still take ground transportation to get to the airport. Passengers often get to the airport an hour or two early to collect their boarding passes, check their luggage, and pass through invasive security checks. On arrival, passengers must wait for their luggage to be delivered on a belt and may even be required to pass through a second full body scan on the way out of the airport. Of course, they need to take a bus or taxi to get to their final destination. This arduous and stressful process makes air travel unattractive whenever there is a viable alternative. Factoring in this check-in and check-out process lengthens the actual travel time dramatically. An ideal transportation system would provide the effective speed and safety we’ve come to expect from air travel – when measured from an initial start point to the final destination.";

Car exhausts have been identified as one of the major sources of environmental pollution. The numbers of deaths and personal injuries directly attributed to traffic accidents we see today would never be tolerated if we were designing a transportation system today. Transportation must be high speed and extremely safe Transportation must provide high capacityIn other words, it is simply not sustainable.

Transportation expenses are so great that, in many cases, it prohibits people from studying at schools that would promote their career prospects. It prevents them from taking employment in other parts of the city. Kathmandu buys fruits and vegetables from India rather than crops in eastern Nepal because the transportation costs are too expensive. People in rural parts of the country cannot access healthcare in Kathmandu because they cannot afford the trip. An ideal transportation system would be affordable to all but the poorest people.
