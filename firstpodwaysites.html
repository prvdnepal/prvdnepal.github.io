            <p><strong>The Podway at the Lumbini Sacred Garden&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>We have already started the preliminary planning. We will elevate the podways about 15 meters<br>above ground level and offer a view of the temples and grounds that have never been available<br>before. The podways will provide convenient stops at all 25 temples located throughout the<br>Garden. The pods will accommodate 12 passengers in each car. The guide rail will have cars<br>available every six minutes to ensure that visitors can move quickly from place to place without<br>any delay.</p>
            <p><br>The podway track will cover a distance of 6 km. The boarding stations will be feature<br>architectural designs that reflect the boarding stations. Visitors will enjoy the podway without<br>an entrance fee.</p>
            <p><em>Our planning schedule</em></p>
            <p><br>Although we are still in the planning stage, our preliminary plans are scheduled as follows:</p>
            <p><br>+ Preliminary planning with detailed mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering. The plans will<br>also provide site plans for the stations, the support posts, the electrical power, and<br>maintenance.</p>
            <p><br>Preliminary planning is scheduled between June and December, 2021.</p>
            <p><br>+ Construction planning includes the logistical support, anchor supports, boarding stations, and<br>podway maintenance.</p>
            <p><br>Construction planning is scheduled between January 2022 and June 2023.</p>
            <p><br>+ System shakedown and commissioning provides management an opportunity to ensure that<br>the podway works as planned. The operations staff will train management in all aspects of the<br>mechanical, electrical, and maintenance of the podway.</p>
            <p><br>Commissioning is scheduled between July 2023 and September 2023.</p>
            <p><br>+ Full opening will be announced when the senior members of cabinet attend the grand<br>opening the podway.</p>
            <p><br>Full opening is scheduled in October 2023.</p><br>
            <p><strong>Podway at Gokarneshwor</strong></p>
            <p><br>Gokarneshwor is located in the northeast side of Kathmandu. The city has a diverse range of<br>geographic, historical, and religious places as well as the Bagmati holy river.</p>

            <p><br>We designed the podway to carry 500,000 passengers a month or about 6,200,000 passengers a<br>year. Our peak hourly demand will be 20% of our daily demand &mdash; or 4,000 an hour.<br>We expect to ship 100 tons of cargo a day on the same route as the passenger line.</p>
